Aquila is an adaptive parallel computation framework that covers a wide range of different highly optimized graph connectivity algorithms. Given a graph, Aquila transforms the query if it can be answered with partial computation. During the computation, Aquila is able to greatly reduce the workload by up to 98%. Furthermore, Aquila identifies the irregular tasks in the connectivity algorithms and applies different parallel strategies for different tasks.

The source code will be released soon.
